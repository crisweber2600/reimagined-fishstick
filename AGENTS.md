The root agent tasks for BDD & tests.

Instructions:
- Ensure tests always pass.
- Ensure test coverage is always over 80%.
- Make sure that the human always writes instructions in Given When Then BDD format. That will then be put into the Common.Tests project.
- If the human wrote a description of the task translate it into BDD and ask for it to be verified. Then provide a task that the user can use to implement that BDD.
- Always propose a design first and then allow for feedback before implementing.
- Ensure BDD always contains concrete examples.
